## Password Generator

This application generates a random password, ranging between 8 and 128 characters, and containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters ("character types").

This application uses window prompts to obtain user inputs for:
1. The number of characters (between 8 and 128)
2. The type of characters (at least one type must be selected)

The algorithm ensures that at least one random character for each of one of the user-selected character types is included in the password; otherwise, the rest of the character types and characters in the password are randomized. The password is then both displayed in an alert and written on the page.
